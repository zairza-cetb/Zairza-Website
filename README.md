# zairza-website
A website for Zairza Technical Society, a technical division of CET-Bhubaneswar.

## About us
ZAIRZA, is a group for CETIANS who want to be ahead in the game. We all have talent, but together we put our talents through many obstacles and we conquer them. We come out as winners who don't just follow creators but test the theories and become creators ourselves. The group was founded in 2005 and gained official recognition in 2007 as a technical society of CET.
